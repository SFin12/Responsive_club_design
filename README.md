# Responsive Club Design

## Codecademy loosely guided

The project was mainly to practice implementing responsive
web design using flex, rem, em, percentages and @media using 
html and css. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) was used for 
the pictures on the website. This was the first website that I 
created starting with a mobile first approach. The form at the 
bottom is not responsive.
